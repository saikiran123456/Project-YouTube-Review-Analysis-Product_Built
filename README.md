YouTube Channel and Review Analysis

### Problem Statement
As we all know the importance of maintaining consistency in any industry is difficult. And every organisation maintains a certain method of reaching the public to know if the service provided by them is acceptable? 
 
So, in the present generation every company/Organisation holds a social media account. Now we will develop a sort of application which can help different customers to know the customer's interest, which is very important nowadays.
 
As a Data scientist, I will analyse the data available in YouTube to help our clients in different ways. 

Here, I have created a robust system product that Automates the process of Data Collection from Source, EDA, Data Preprocessing, Feature Engineering, and deployment :Displaying Dashboard(with multiple Visuals to see the insights)

Extensive Research and Development has been put in this project by me, Several Changes have been re-made to make this Entire Pipeline!

System Product Deployed on Streamlit and Published/Hosted on HEROKU will be making Public on other Sites aswell!

Have a YouTube API Key Ready for Yourself to Explore any YouTube that you want to analyse!

(It's a Light weight and Only 2 Clicks needed!)
