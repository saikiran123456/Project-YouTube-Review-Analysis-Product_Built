I took it back to the dealership in Fresno and Jeff was very receptive and gave us a rental until the engine was replaced.  Iam not signing on to this due to the fact that our dealership took care of us as if we were family. Sometimes great quality service ..sound mind and conscious outweighs a lawsuit.

if I buy xe and spent extra money aftermarket to make this model XZ is it worth it? a lot of people say don't do any wiring-related work aftermarket as it causes problems after some time. 

same with XM variant.

conclusion- or I directly go to XZ variant and skip all aftermarket work.

Nexon has blaind spot in the right A pillar, it has big cabin noice, and a lot of body roll. Even clutch is also harder than XUV 300. But in XUV 300 is far better in all the above. No cabin noice, very less almost no body roll, very easy light clutch. Very fun to drive. More safer then Nexon because of all wheal disc brake and 6 air bags. The 17"" allay wheel give you more stable and confident drive. Besides XUV is heavier than Nexon. XUV300 is the best in this segment. Go for XUV 300. It has fun to drive strong punchy diesel engine.

Arun Das,"Hi all
Please think before purchasing xuv300. I got my diesel w6 on 13 DEC and after running 518km the vehicle broke down and  i had shift it  to service center on 17 DEC just after 3 days. MH Customer support is pathetic. Their "" with u hamesha"" support is funny they just give u service center contact number of ur city. On being contacted there they will again provide u with the nearest service center number and that goes  on... You have run from post to pillar to get this thing repaired.  I may be unlucky with my car but please dont go after the hype and choose brands with better support. Right now the service centre guy is saying it will take 15 days to replace the failed part.

monjena,"After completing the spiti trip we are stuck in Manali from past two days..our 4months old Mahindra Thar got towed due to some OBD Check Lamp warning..the car is not able to pull beyond 1500rpm. The Mahindra service center tried to reduce the soot mass for last 2 days and now  they are saying ordering a DPF filter is going to take another 7-8days and we will have to wait for it. Also they are saying fault is with us as we didn't do Regen while we didn't get any Regen warning.
They are also saying they can't share the data now ,even after 2 days of analysis.
DPF filter costs 70k and doesn't come under warranty. Even we were ready to pay just to join office in time, but now they are saying it will take 7-8days to get the DPF filter. Go for any other SUV it is just a good looking car and will make you feel you are driving a powerful car but it is just the feeling but in reality it is unreliable",2021-09-21T18:07:36Z,0,0

Saurabh Sood,"Fact about Kia/ Hyundai:
The Global NCAP cars sold in other countries and similar looking car sold in India are Slightly different platform.
Indian people are given a Sub- Standard version of the vehicle which are fitted with bells and whistles.
Kia Seltos
Worldwide platform: P2
Indian platform : P2i
Difference:
Ultra high strength steel in Global platform is switched by high strength steel which is a cheaper low quality variety.
Kia and Hyundai share the same platforms in India.
So 
It could be true for your Hyundai car as well.
TATA motors are transparent and they clearly advertise their platform.
Before buying that fancy Hyundai/ Kia, 
Do take time to check the facts.",2021-06-22T08:53:51Z,84,19

Ajay Hooda,@Shivam Anand I am telling this on behalf of my experience mate coz I have travelled in xuv and really sonet's driving and travelling experience is much better than xuv and there's no problem that u like xuv and yes everybody have their own preferences but arun sachdeva doesn't understand this thing,2021-03-07T11:20:20Z,0,

It's a matter of personal preference; both are excellent.
Both Kia and Mahindra have customers.",2021-03-07T11:10:43Z,0,

Shivam Anand,"@Ajay Hooda I'm no expert, but I believe the Mahindra Xuv 300 provides more comfort.
The most basic features, such as seat comfort & head room, are provided by Mahindra.
Advance features come only after basic features.
Mahindra is also well-known among local repair shops also.
And 💯 Indian brands has done a good job.",2021-03-07T09:27:15Z,1,

Arun Sachdeva,"@Ajay Hooda so you rejected xuv coz  you didnt find its speakers good..wowww what a reason so its clear you need features not safety not a strong car, sonet has very less rear sitting compared to xuv , people buy swift coz they have budget issues they cant go beyond 6-7 laks but if we can afford then we should go with stronger car, jfyi i own honda city currently.
you want to buy a feature full car coz you want to show off nothing else .. this is the reason that car manufacturers in india like maruti and kia are growing in india coz they know indian buyers dont need safer and strong cars they want features ..cool bro ..all the best enjoy your sonet!!",2021-03-03T22:05:09Z,1,
Ajay Hooda,@Arun Sachdevapura pdhio reply phir jawab dio  ajkal jaise technology badh rahi hai around the world including cars to ek aisi gaadi must banchuki hai jo ki feature loaded ho taaki agle 6 7 saal tak car fresh aur new feel taaki family me bccho me ye na rhe ki uske dosto ke paas achi car hai unke paas nhi aur bado ko bhi aisa feel ho aur bc new car lene ke 2 mahine baad hi agar wo purani lgne lgjae to gnnta kuch faida hua gaddi lene ka itne paise kharch krke aur zaruri nhi hai ki agar 5 star rated ho car safety me to jaan hi na jae . Swift ke stars dekhe hai ? Phir bhi log itna lete hai us car ko . Agar insan khud responsibly gaadi chlaega to kuch nhi bigdega aur 4 aur 5 star me bhi 19 20 ka fark rehta hai same with car performance maine dono chlai hai aur main sonet ke andar baithne ke baad xuv khaali dbba lgi chlane me bhi mza nhi aya kyuki speakers itne khrab the aur tumhe leni hai xuv to paise barbad krlo hume koi fark nhi pdta mere paas to verna hai and I have booked Kia sonet gt line black and also be happy with your xuv 300,2021-03-03T21:41:20Z,1,

Samir Rajkonwar,"Well I have driven the diesel variants of sonnet, xuv and nexon. Have to say the pull that you get from xuv diesel is something that is very addictive and that's the reason why I bought this car. I owned a for Figo previously so m in love with torquee diesel engines. Xuv is the only engine that impressed me. I really don't care about features much. I am a driving enthusiast and I drive a lot. In that aspect xuv is the clear winner. My brother has a ecosport and that that car is by far the best driver's sub 4 meter car, xuv 300 comes next",2020-11-29T17:13:05Z,7,0

I just want to say for a lot of people out there looking for the best car/value for money car/car that has everything. Space doesn't always mean - the car is better. And lot of features doesn't again mean the car is better. Everyone likes things which make them smile at the end of the day. After that value for money and all other things won't matter. Find out, what car is that for you.  Sonet - I feel would make me do that. I love it's features, looks, etc. The ride handling, sportiness is enough for me to make myself feel good. I don't mind spending the extra buck for the same. Again, to each it's own. Your priorities might be entirely different. Hit a like if you share my views. Peace. 😎",2020-11-01T19:28:28Z,8,4

Ishaan Revankar,"@MotorOctane There are many videos in youtube which show that Tata's dealerships are very bad in terms of response. Check out in youtube. Many Nexon owners may not say that. But it is your duty to make a research on these dealerships. The dealerships are the main reason why the Harrier is still not selling well compared to the Creta, Seltos and Hector as these automakers provide better dealerships. I agree that Harrier is a very phenomenal suv and it is far better than most of the alternatives like the Seltos, Creta, Hector and the pricey Compass. But Tata Motors should improve their dealerships. This news is there in plenty in youtube. Please make a research on these dealerships. If the dealership is good then the customer will be confident to but that particular car from the dealership. The Harrier really deserves more sales. But the dealership s of Tata Motors are the weak link and thus discourage s customer s to buy the Harrier, especially when spending more than 20 lakhs.",2020-10-29T04:53:40Z,0,

Niranjan R. Fulsundar,@Himani Pachchigar xuv300 has front-wheel drive too which none of the cars in this segment is offering. The biggest con is it doesn't have good boot space but it gives you ample space in the second row with super leg space. Built quality is also top-notch in xuv 300 just try closing the car doors.. The sound of the closing door is so satisfying.. These few points made me change my mind to go with XUV 300,2020-11-01T13:53:47Z,5,

Gaurav Dubey,"अगर आप kia Sonet के GT line के अलावा कोई भी और model लेने जा रहे है तो ये पोस्ट आपके लिए है!!

दोस्तों ज़रूर kia की ये गाड़ी sonet आपको बहुत लुभावनी लग रही है और क्यों ना लगे १३ लाख में बहुत फ़ीचर kia आपको ऑफ़र कर रही है लेकिन क्या यही सचाई है अगर नहीं तो कैसे 

Kia ने अपनी GT लाइन के नीचे के models में लुभावने features तो कई दिए है मगर सुरक्षा विशेषताओं को अनदेखा किया है इसमें बुनियादी सुरक्षा उपकरण और features नहीं है जैसे ESP, CSC, Traction control और hill road assit या roll over mitigation, VSM जो इस तरह की ऊँची गाड़ी के लिए बहुत ज़रूरी है और इनको बहुत ज़रूरी है!

ख़रीदने से पहले सोचे ये गाड़ी कितनी सुरक्षित है क्या ये भारतीय रोड के हिसाब से सुरक्षित है!!

इसी कारण से GNACP ये गाड़ी का टेस्ट नहीं हो रहा है !

अभी भी कुछ बेवक़ूफ़ शायद ये comments करेंगे कि आप GT लाइन ले लो मगर ये बताओ कि why comany create those unsafe models.

मेरा उद्देश्य किसी brand की image को बिगाड़ना नहीं अपितु रोड accident से बचना है इस unsafe car में आपकी family के साथ साथ मेरी फ़ैमिली भी unsafe है",2020-10-19T23:18:04Z,0,0

Kia,Nexon,Venue, XUV all are hitech machines and they can be serviced only in authorized service center.again the service issues depend on the area u stay.if there r good service centres in ur area, then both XUV and Nexon are good..but one thing for sure, one fuse blown and v have to run diagnostics on the scanner/computer that is available only in service center... consider this before u buy a hitech car. if any technical snag occurs while long journeys, sometimes its very very painful coz of no road side assistance and turnaround time to resolve issue. always read the service manuals and b familiar with it before you go on any journey..best luck 👍🏻",2020-10-24T13:08:25Z,23,

Here's a couple from my experience: It's infotainment system is horrible-super clunky to use. Plastics used in Top of Dashboard look n feel cheap. That grey top plastics will not age well.

Hare Haran,"After test driving almost all the vehicles in the segment..purchased XUV 300 diesel amt..pretty much satisfied about the purchase. Overall vehicle build, ride quality and handling has been excellent. Best in class power and torque compared to its rivals. Ergonomically and visibility wise I felt it very good in this vehicle..No neck pain or back pain after 5-6 hours continuous long drive. I didn't feel good about head support in nexon. Another important thing is rear seating comfort, 3 people can comfortably sit in XUV 300..whereas others I found it difficult and best leg room is offered in this vehicle. Only let down in this vehicle what I feel is the boot space. I made that sacrifice as my priority was rear seating comfort over boot space. Steering modes in this vehicle was a standout thing..felt its importance especially when riding on highways, the steering becomes hard/heavy when you put it on sport mode offering better stability on highway. When driving in city you can have it in comfort mode, steering is as light as any other hyundai or a Honda electronic power steering.",2020-10-08T10:48:25Z,4,2
Hare Haran,"@Adarsh Noolvi in highways i am getting 20kmpl, in city between 12.5 to 13.5kmpl, I have checked both tank to tank and the system one as well, both correlate eachother. When you compare this amt to  nexons amt..this is far far better. Nexon I get to feel lot of jerks, in this it is subtle you won't get to feel it very hard. You cannot completely avoid the Jerks while shifting, that's nature of any Amt transmission. XUV has refined AMT. Only you will feel the 1st to 2nd gear transmission little awkward in the auto mode..as it is designed in such a way that this transmission happens only when it reaches 2000 RPM,  shifting of  other gears 2nd and above is pretty smooth, you won't even feel any anything  while shifting. I usually shift 1st to 2nd gear in manual mode as it allows to do the shift 1000 RPM and then put it to auto mode for hassle free experience. Throttle response is amazing in this vehicle, when ever you need power the vehicle delivers it,  which isn't the case in most of the Amt. Overall drive quality and stability of vehicle on the highways is superb. I don't have any regrets on purchasing this vehicle except the slightly small boot space.",2020-10-26T14:53:06Z,0,

Birthsquad Endless Road,"@Vini look I am not that of expert, but I can say xuv300 has better handling than nexon. Power delivery is so sweet in xuv300. 

Look i will help you, how i bought a car. 
I made few points which I require a car to have. 

These are mines:
1. Torque (coz i hill in hilly area) 
2. Decent ground clearance 
3. Pickup speed
4. Better second sit
5. Good looking 

That's all.... So xuv 300 fits for me in these points. 

If you have lots of luggage to carry then don't buy xuv300... But if your luggage is not problem than go for xuv300. 

Its better if you get diesel variant w4. Better mileage and 300 nm of Torque.",2021-05-02T01:00:22Z,0,

Adityan r varier,"@Shashank Sharma soo true ...what everyone said about xuv 300 on this comnent session...i dnt know why its soo underrated..may be it cannot cop up with features by koreans ..but a car is not only features ..its a machine which is to be given priority..even mileage can be negotiated if engine is that good .

We were looking for a sub 4 m suv ...and had test driven sonet,venue ,brezza ..in venue due to poor back seat comfort we dropped it then itself .then it was brezza which was a good driveable car...driving felt pleasure but something felt missing(may be we strongly had a dezire to try another company than maruti suzuki,and sunroof was kinda mandatory for family members)
So dropped it too..then it was kia sonet..we almost fixed the car but our family members felt something lacking in rear seat ,even though it had ac vents ,rear charging ports, comfort was missing there ...seats were not that great,leg room okey but bad thigh support ....
Then accidentally we saw a test drive xuv300 vehicle ..done a test drive and woah🔥🔥🔥till then we didnt see the engine performance as a benchmark in selecting vehicles due to tendency towards features provided by kia,hyundai..but after xuv we undrrstood that kia and hyundai were laggy and underpowered .

So if you can spent 14lkhs
If bootspace is not a big deal
If you are not a mileage lover
If korean features do not attract you 

I strongly reccomend xuv300 for
That torqy engine
Best in class back seat comfort

rajoo solanky,"Comparison should also include Quality of After-Sales Services, availability of Spares, Labour & regular Services charges.
Purchasing a Car is the start of big relationship with the Co. for atleast 5 years. Trust on Reliability & Durability of Car is developed upon by this important aspect of After-Sales Services. And Tata Services fails in that department since I have suffered the worst as Tata Car owner. Tired of maintaining it for 5 years, got fed up finally sold it at Scrape value. Because of high maintenance cost Nobody is interested in buying used Tata cars That's the main reason Tata cars does not fetch good Resale value in Used car market.
Tata is yet to produce world class refined engines especially Petrol. Check Tata Cars Tiago, Tigor & Nexon Exports nos. datas for a clearer picture.
*Apart from Good looks & strong body shell your car should have refined, responsive & low NVH level Engine (Heart) alongwith well trained Service engineers (Doctors) & Service Stn (Multi-speciality Hospitals) to take care of the health of your Car for atleast 5 years. And Tata lacks in all 3 - Heart, Doctors & Hospitals. Think twice before you invest your hard earned money in Tata Cars since they offer the least warranty on major parts*",2020-10-05T18:58:12Z,1,0

Harsh Dave,"I have booked Tata Nexon XZ+ a few days back. Reasons for going with Tata Nexon 

1) Best in terms of safety. The build quality is very strong. Just look at some of the videos of Tata Nexon accident crashes and find out yourself. Jab jaan hi nahi rahegi toh features ka achaar daaloge kya.
2) Subtle interiors. I am more of a minimalist kind of person and don't like a lot of clutter. I felt that the interiors of tata Nexon are quite subtle and the lights looked classy at the night time.    
3) Drive modes for different driving conditions. You can select the mode depending on your needs. Whether you want more power or more mileage. 

4) Good music system. Harman is a recognized brand and the sound quality was at par with Bose music system which is in Sonet highest variant. 
5) Good space on the rear seat for 3 people to sit comfortably. The extra thigh support on Nexon's seats is very comfortable. 2 males and 1 female can sit without any discomfort but it can be slightly inconvenient for 3 males. The rear seating space on Kia was shocking for me. I currently own Hyundai Accent and trust me, the rear seat of Kia Sonet provides lesser space than my Accent. This was the reason why I didn't even consider buying Sonet. If after spending close to 10 lakhs, even 5 people cant sit inside the car comfortably, toh kya hi matlab hai car lene ka. 
6) High ground clearance - very useful on Indian roads
7) Sufficient boot space",2020-10-05T05:03:27Z,215,42

lucky dhiman,Nexon is good and Safe car but the quality of the product is not great as some people suggest on Internet. there are panel gaps and rattling sounds come after a year.  After sales service is really bad at most of the tata service centers.,2020-10-08T06:51:35Z,7,
Mayur Mahindrakar,"@Harsh
Agree with most of your comments and not questioning your choice however questioning your sources of information.
If you are judging build quality based on youtube videos, trust me you're making a big mistake. None of the youtube videos show all facts of accidents and they are making videos for their advantage. Since TATA Nexon is famous on social media you'll find videos favouring Tata Nexon for more views. If you know any Youtubers personally talk to them. I personally have seen how data is manipulated. However Tata Nexon is really safe car not upto mark with XUV300 though because you can feel it when in car.
Spacewise again XUV300 is better than Nexon however you loose badly on boot space.
Ground clearance is enough for all cars considering indian roads because it is combination of ground clearance and suspension set up.
Sound quality in nexon is great however sonet has changed the game because the Bose set up in sonet is way ahead of everyone else (however it is in top trim).
The only issues with Nexon is it's life and maintenance because it's Tata Motors and i have experience with Tata so just sharing what is the fact. Long term life of Tata cars is certainly not preferred as you'll be starting to hear sounds from car after few years which are not assuring if you are in absolute love with your car else people drive even Tata sumo for many years.

Rest I'll say it's a great choice however service experience will matter in long term.
And of course it depends on your priorities with a car so good choice I'll say except not to be kept for longer duration with you.",2020-10-08T04:25:31Z,9,

Please understand basics of torque and BHP before educating someone else. A race car would have more BHP to reach higher speeds but a truck will have more torque to pull heavy loads so it all depends on what you want to do with your vehicle.

Ady Pahuja,"@ꜱᴜᴍᴇᴅʜ ✪ you just repeated what I said above. Lol BHP is not horse power but brake horse power haha. While torque is an essential indicator of overall performance of an engine, BHP is actually referred to as power. So technically an engine that produces 150 BHP with 250 nm torque has more power than an engine that produces 130 BHP with 300 nm torque. Petrol engines generally have higher BHP but lower torque while diesel engines produce more torque than BHP. Does that mean diesel engines are less powerful?
No
If you were a truly a car enthusiast you would know that duster 1.3 turbo, kicks 1.3 turbo ( same engines ) produce about 154 BHP with higher torque. XUV 300 neither provides that much power nor the features like Kia sonet.",2020-10-27T09:07:30Z,0,

Idk about you, but Venue shouldn't even be called Compact SUV.
Nor does it have comfort, ground clearance, handling or feel of an suv which Nexon has.
None has performance of an real SUVz ofcourse they're nor real wheel drive(RWD) or four wheel drive(4FWD)
Nexon is still better overall choice.

For city and in petrol automatic, Venue wouldn't be a problem, it's a great choice then.
Still, Venue doesn't deserve to be called a Compact SUV though however great the DCT is.
The only proper compact SUV would be TUV 300, with rear wheel drive (RWD).
But Xuv 300 and Nexon are the best overall choices along the line.

ꜱᴜᴍᴇᴅʜ ✪,"@Ady Pahuja 
BHP isn't horse power again, it's brake horse power.
You need to go back to 12th and learn the basic Power's formula first.
You've just googled about momentum and stuff.

Torque works against the force, bhp works towards the force.
In short, bhp is useful when you're at higher speeds. Car will accelerate faster then.
At lower to medium engine speeds, Torque is more crucial. Hence you feel the pull, at the lower Rpms.
You can cruise easily without changing gears.

So higher bhp will result in a faster car.
But at the initial and mid engine revving stage, car with more torque will surpass the car with higher bhp.
As higher bhp cars have late red lines and high rpm swings to reach the optimum speeds, generally petrol cars.

So currently in market all the petrol cars you see have very low torque when compared to diesel cars.
So less mileage, nor are they faster than Diesel variants.
But in racing world, cars are designed keeping bhp and Torque in comparable proportions.
And petrol is more preferred as it burns more nicely & quickly.

Power isn't just determined by BHP.
You've to take Torque into consideration as well.
You can feel the difference of Torque even if it's increased by 10 but in the case of BHP, it isn't noticeable.

So technically, Xuv 300 followed by Nexon offer the most powerful engine in its segment, period.
Sonet is very close though.

Alankar Das,"Hi Rachit ! 
Thanks for the review....that was really awesome 👍
One important thing that you missed or I can say you keep missing is that whenever you test an Automatic car it's very important to emphasize that most of the variants of that particular car is having a Hill Assist Control (HAC) or not. 
I have observed that you test the Automatic cars on almost flat surfaces rather than on a really steep climb like Hill driving or even the exit of a Mall Parking. This feature is really very important because if someone buys Venue iMT (except the top model) or Sonet iMT, the company is not providing the  HAC feature. I believe Sonet has this feature in DCT variant which is quite expensive and most of the people won't opt for it.
It's a request, kindly do highlight the importance of having the HAC while giving reviews of an Automatic car. 
This will be good and also an eye opener for all those buyers who are not aware how much importance this feature holds while buying an Automatic car. 
A lay man will always think that the car he/she will be buying is an Automatic version so it will never roll backwards because of the creep function that the car offers . But at the same time it's also important to know and understand that the creep feature only works properly on a flat surface and won't prevent the car from rolling backwards if you stop midway and then try to accelerate while driving against a steep climb.
Thank you !",2020-10-04T09:45:51Z,72,4

jas tinu,I have watched several videos on compact SUVs but this is the best and most appropriate. It says only truth. I can say this because recently I bought Nexon AMT. The description is absolutely correct that its bit jerky but you can get rid of it by a little practice and it depends on selection of driving mode and road type. I was scared before going to mountains but I found its ride quality is amazing specially the hill hold. It will not move back even an inch. At the end only thing I can say about this video is that after watching this one there is no need to watch any other video just go and buy the car of his choice.,2020-10-03T17:57:06Z,95,6

jas tinu,Ppl say that DCT is better but of course for that you need to pay about 1 lakh extra. AMT for initial few days you will feel little lag but once your feet get used to it you will overcome it. Personally I am enjoying AMT but if you are a rash driver and always in hurry then should go for DCT.,2020-10-08T19:20:47Z,4,
jas tinu,"So far no issues with break. I had gone to Shimla and at present Chandigarh-Shimla highway is in bad shape. Personally I could not find any issue.

suhail khan,"Hi Rachit I watch all your videos, infact I liked  the video to some extent but I felt somewhere you were biased with Sonet . Agree Sonet has best features but these features come only in Top variants like HTX+ or GTX+ whose price is higher than  any other compact SUVs in the same segment. Also in HTE,HTK,HTK plus hardly you get any features which sonet highlights apart from the exterior. HTX has everything but only IMT and features are less again compared to its upper variant. In the conclusion you have suggested all cars but completely ignored XUV 300. 1. If i see your previous reviews of XUV 300 it was promoted a lot now completely ignored in the end.2. It has NCAP rating safety features more than Nexon Adult 5 stars and Child 4 stars. Somewhere I was disappointed with bias review as sonet is 14- 15 +lakhs on road which you are highlighting more.",2020-10-02T11:52:01Z,0,0

Saurabh Sood,"@motoroctane Since Kia Sonet diesel automatic costs nearly same as the base Tata Harrier Automatic,
Please make a comparison of both.
It is interesting to note that all those who want space at this price range can also opt for the Mahindra Marrazzo which is larger than all of these.
You must compare Kia Sonet  diesel with Marrazzo Diesel manual since they fall in similar price bracket.
Spend your hard earned money after checking out the Marrazzo Diesel and the Tata Harrier.
An extra Lakh spent while buying the car 🚗 is justified
Rather than regretting later for the decision.
Journey is comfortable with space and suspension and air-conditioning.
Marrazzo Diesel is having the best air-conditioning, space and comfort as compared to the small sub 4 m Sonet. Also Excellent braking and bigger tyres.
The features will be forgotten and unused after the first few days.
However when you travel and you are pressed for space,
The comfort goes out of the window.",2020-10-02T10:36:19Z,8,2

Yogesh Rao,"Sonet & Venue : Poor Ride quality,poor Handling & dynamics, poor Rear seat space, poor visibility in Sonet, Good transmission, blah blah un-necessary features which goes bad will cost the owner in a just a few years, probably korean cars look bettter for some.

Nexon : Nexon has good ride quality, handling & dynamics & good rear seat space, Offers top line safety features from base variant and has a 5 star safety rating, poor transmission and features come at a premium.

XUV 300 : Decent in everything Nexon is at but comes at a premium also transmission is not great as well, the mileage is worst but performance is best in the segment.

Nexon looks the best bet from VFM point of view, Sonet is close 2nd, Xuv 300 is for enthusiast for whom 0.1 sec better pickup matters, Venue is for people who want a mix of topline features and good transmission at lower cost. Sonet has many forms, it offers everything but not great in any of them apart from features",2020-10-02T09:46:43Z,0,0

Vikrant Upadhyay,"petrol gdi n diesel prices r same in sonet as per my understanding due to old n new technology in engine.
diesel manual have WGT which is less costly n old tech than VGT which they r giving with AT diesel in other side you r getting turbo petrol +GDI + imt( 20k more than manual transmission in std by cost) which is more advance and costly in terms of technology n price than WGT. tht wht i understood after pricing of kia sonet.they r not fool tht keep diesel price less actualy they using older turbo tech in diesel engine to enhance milage so there cost is less in manual. btw as per kia its introductory price who knows in jan feb they will increase diesel price specialy for 50 k minimum than petrol which is current trend in all csuvs?they r just waiting for response n they got exceptional response from customer 12 days more than 9000 units sales 35000 booking.wht else they want more ? haha",2020-10-02T09:44:47Z,0,0

Also if they can upgrade infotainment & bring MID(this digital MID doesn't feel  good for this car at all) from their other premium cars at least in XZ (& above trims)  with ex. showroom price of XZ petrol between 9.5-10 lacks, this will be best bang for the buck car along with XM & XMS for average consumers. Tata has nailed the XMS but they have nothing to compete against Sonet HTX & Venue SX. Also clutchless manual is better than AMT & very easy to add since they just need to remove some parts & modify the AMT.",2020-10-02T09:05:00Z,0,0

NEXON's rear seat is 48 Inch and Xuv rear seat is 53 inch that make huge difference. you own duster u must know about driving dynamics as i own volkswagen jetta, i love to drive and i prefer car with better build quality and better handling where XUV gives better handling it has large tyres and long wheelbase wide as well, and as I said both cars has 5 star Rating then on which point u can say that nexon is better, except sound system and cusioning",2020-10-04T13:32:15Z,1,

Poojan Raval,"​@kite ​ @Jatt rx  May be you own Nexon so u are so much into nexon, Listen my friend. There are many things to consider, Nexon is good as well but rear seat capacity is better in xuv, handling is better in xuv, power is more in xuv, features are more in xuv though most of not useful, Nexon on other hand has more bootspace and music system is top in nexon, ground clearance is best in nexon, but none of us will drive our cars on rivers and stuffs, 180 mm is sufficient on daily uses on highway and cities and bad roads, Xuv bootspace i would say it has enuf bootspace to keep small 4 or 5 small trolleybags, and i dont think we always need so much boot space hardly we use full bootspace once in a year or twice, Xuv doesnt have rear ac vents but ac is powerful to cool rear fast too. Mileage is lower than nexon so the power is high. Both has 5 Star ncap rating and both are international models, seating cusioning is better in nexon. and now top model price of nexon is higher than top model xuv as well. So consider these points then decide which car is good.. i own none of them. I am planning.. Rather than buying fancy stuffs we should look how many people can sit comfortably. I would say xuv300 has enuf space at rear for 3 people to seat comfortably, i dont need that much bootspace so i am ok with bootspace. handling is better than all of these 3 cars. power is good too.. Everything is good apart from that shitty central consol ac wheel and buttons which looks so cheap. i dont need Auto Dimming IRVM, Auto HeadLamps, Wireless Charger, Auto Headlight, Sun Roof, Dual zone ac, Rain sensing wipers, mood lights and stuffs, These Features are useless in Indian Lifestlye and weather. So be Practical and choose wisely.",2020-10-04T12:42:27Z,0,
Pratham Salvi,@kite how many times will you use the boot? 3 people can't seat comfortably in Nexon. Because the middle seat base is less. Overall xuv300 better hai comfort mei. Xuv300 nexon se better highway cruising kar sakti hai. Nexon Ka base variants sasta hai xuv se lekin top model xuv se bhi mehenga hai. 15 lacs ke upar hai top model.
